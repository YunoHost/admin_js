Initial YunoHost web administration was built by Kload, for YunoHost v2.

Most of code was written by opi, with help of numerous contributors.

Translation is made by a bunch of lovely people over the world.

We would like to thank anyone who ever helped the YunoHost project, and especially the web administration project <3
