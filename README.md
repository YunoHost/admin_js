##Â Installation

This client is a part of the YunoHost projet, and can not be installed directly. Please visit [YunoHost website](https://yunohost.org) for more information.

## Contributing

Feel free to improve the plugin and send us a pull request.

We use `gulp` to compile Less files and minify the JavaScript. Assuming [nodejs](http://nodejs.org/) is installed, you can install dependencies and run a build with:

```sh
cd src
npm install
npm run build
```

Alternatively you can run `npm run build-dev` which improves building speed by bypassing compression tasks.

On a YunoHost instance, the web admin files are located at `/usr/share/yunohost/admin`.

**Note:** The `.ms` - moustache - files are cached by the browser. You have to
reach them manually some times you modify them. (e.g. go to
https://example.com/yunohost/admin/views/domain/domain_list.ms)
